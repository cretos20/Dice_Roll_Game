# Dice Roll Comparison Game

## Overview

Dice Roll Comparison Game is a simple web application built using JavaScript that simulates rolling two dice. It randomly generates numbers for each die, compares the results, and declares a winner or a tie if both dice show the same number. This project showcases core JavaScript functionalities including random number generation, comparison logic, and dynamic updates to the user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page (optional, depending on your implementation).
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the dice roll logic and dynamic UI updates.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/cretos20/Dice_Roll_Game.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Dice_Roll_Game
3. **Open index.html in your web browser:**
    You can open the index.html file directly in your web browser to view the application.

## How It Works
- **Rolling the Dice:**
When the user clicks the "Roll Dice" button, the application generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 (inclusive).
Each number corresponds to the result of rolling a die.

- **Displaying Results:**
The results of the dice rolls are displayed on the web page.
The numbers rolled are compared to determine the winner.

- **Determining the Winner:**
If the number on the first die is greater than the number on the second die, the first die is declared the winner.
If the number on the second die is greater than the number on the first die, the second die is declared the winner.
If both numbers are the same, the result is a tie
